RT catalyzes DNA replication from an RNA template, and is responsible for the replication of retroelements. An RT gene is usually indicative of a mobile element such as a retrotransposon or retrovirus. RTs are present in a variety of mobile elements, including retrotransposons, retroviruses, group II introns, bacterial msDNAs, hepadnaviruses, and Caulimoviruses.
